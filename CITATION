	abstract= {We provide in this AFP entry several relative soundness 
                   results for security protocols. In particular, we prove 
                   typing and compositionality results for stateful protocols
                   (i.e., protocols with mutable state that may span several
                   sessions), and that focuses on reachability properties. Such
                   results are useful to simplify protocol verification by 
                   reducing it to a simpler problem: Typing results give 
                   conditions under which it is safe to verify a protocol in a 
                   typed model where only "well-typed" attacks can occur whereas 
                   compositionality results allow us to verify a composed protocol
                   by only verifying the component protocols in isolation. The 
                   conditions on the protocols under which the results hold are 
                   furthermore syntactic in nature allowing for full automation. 
                   The foundation presented here is used in another entry to 
                   provide fully automated and formalized security proofs of 
                   stateful protocols.},
